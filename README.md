New_Python_for_Beginners
========================

Tired of programmers et al sending you to the haystack known as "the documentation," where you have to google every other word just to get started? Then, you spend more time googling what the answers mean in Stackn Overflow? This repo has tutorials for people who are not only new to Python but new to programming and want to learn the latest version. Basics should be digestible so you can ramp up quickly and breeze through the documentation like a champ!

Want to help new programmers learn faster? If you find tutorials on new versions of Python (currently Python 3) that new learners can use or if you discover expired links, feel free to push additions to this page.
